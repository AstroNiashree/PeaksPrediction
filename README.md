# PeaksPrediction
# GitHub Repository README

This repository contains MATLAB code for predicting and visualizing a 3D surface using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The code generates plots for the predicted surface and its uncertainty at different sections.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (R2016a or later)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Run the `main.m` file.

## Code Explanation
The code performs the following steps:

1. Generates a 3D surface using the `peaks` function.
2. Creates training data by reshaping the X and Y coordinates of the surface.
3. Fits a Gaussian Process Regression model (`gprMdl1`) to the training data.
4. Creates new observation points for prediction.
5. Predicts the surface values for the new observation points using the trained model.
6. Reshapes the predicted values and uncertainties for plotting.
7. Generates various plots to visualize the predicted surface and its uncertainties.

## File Description
- `main.m`: Main script to run the code.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Results
The code generates several figures to visualize the predicted surface and its uncertainties:

- Figure 1: Original 3D surface generated using the `peaks` function.
- Figure 2: Predicted plot from the trained data.
- Figure 3: Predicted plot from the trained data with uncertainty visualization.
- Figure 4: Plot of the predicted surface along the YN axis at XN = 2.
- Figure 5: Plot of the predicted surface along the YN axis at XN = -2.
- Figure 6: Plot of the predicted surface along the XN axis at YN = 2.
- Figure 7: Plot of the predicted surface along the XN axis at YN = -2.
